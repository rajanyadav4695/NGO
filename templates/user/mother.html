        <p>Gracious Givers has started serving meals to homeless mothers.
Currently, the NGO is feeding them in Vrindavan to ensure that they can live a life of dignity and respect. Cooked meals are provided to a thousand of them to ensure that women who live alone, are not devoid of healthy meals.
DONATE FRESHLY COOKED MEALS WITH YOUR SUPPORT
There are over 40 million widowed women in India.
That means that 10% of the female population are living without their husbands.
Many of them are abandoned by their families and children, hunger is the immediate issue that needs to be addressed. A moderately active woman should consume 1,800-2,200 calories a day. Hot, fresh, nutritious and hygienic meals help them survive and ward off diseases that come their way.
